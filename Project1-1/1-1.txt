Homework 1, Due
Problem 1. 
Description
This program will create small, snake-like increment tables, up to 9x9 in size. It starts from 1, and the value keep increasing by one. For the first row, it increase from left to right; for the second row, it increase from right to left; the third row, from left to right, ... , etc.  Just like a snake. 
Sample output is below:

>java SnakeTable
Enter table size 1-9, 0 to exit: 9
	1       2        3         4       5         6        7        8        9
        18      17      16      15      14      13      12      11      10
        19      20      21      22      23      24      25      26      27
        36      35      34      33      32      31      30      29      28
        37      38      39      40      41      42      43      44      45
        54      53      52      51      50      49      48      47      46
        55      56      57      58      59      60      61      62      63
        72      71      70      69      68      67      66      65      64
        73      74      75      76      77      78      79      80      81 

Enter table size 1-9, 0 to exit: 3
	 1	 2	 3
	 6	 5	 4
	 7	 8	 9

Enter table size 1-9, 0 to exit: 1
	 1

Enter table size 1-9, 0 to exit: 746
please enter a number in the range 0-9

Enter table size 1-9, 0 to exit: -231
please enter a number in the range 0-9

Enter table size 1-9, 0 to exit: 0
      
Specification
The program should repeatedly request input in the range 0-9 (sample code to get console input is below). Numbers outside this range should be politely rejected. 0 will stop execution of the program. Numbers not parseable as integers should also cause the program to exit. 
For input in the 1-9 range, the program should produce a multiplication table as shown above. The formatting does not have to precisely match the above, but the numbers should be in columns. You may use any combination of tabs and spaces for formatting. I would avoid Java's NumberFormatter classes for this one, but if you're feeling daring, go for it. 

Points
10 pts: Some semblance of a Java program, compiles 
10 pts: Accepts integer input 
20 pts: Prints out multiplication tables for 1-9, quits on 0, check the range bound 
10 pts: Correctly formatted table 
Getting Input
Sample code for reading an integer from the console is in the Input.java file. You shouldn't use this java file directly, just use the part of getting input of it.
